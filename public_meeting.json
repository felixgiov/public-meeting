31. of which £545 19d 3d is rates raised to the end of the year, £25), and from the land fund £90. special receipt being contributions and proportion of balance left by the late yatala road board, applicable to the hindmarsh and reed beds road. the total expenditure for six months amounts to £208 13id, of which £100 was paid for assessing and mapping the district; £36 158 for salary o clerk, including per centage on rates collected; £28 | 195 11d; oflice rent, books, and stationery. 24218s 21, for advertisements, legal, and other incidentu expenses. yur council in retiring from oslice, are happy to report that they leave a balance on band amountng to £767 6s 2d, which with the amount of assessments yet receivable, aed the balance of aid expected from the government, will enable their successor's to prosecute with vigour, those much desired improvements which want of necessary funds in due season, has prevented those now retiring from attemptin. in onclusion we are hapyy to remark that the business of this intelligent and important district, is us it ought to be in „ce of all the other districts und we caut abstain from congratulating the ratepayers upon having secured the services of an olicer in the capacity of clerk, so intelligent, and in all respects eficient, as mr downing has proved bimise to be signed on behalf of the council, robt. r. torrens, chairman, december 30, 1863.

MORRISON'S ELECTION.PUBLIC MEETING AT SORELL.ANUMEROUS and most respectably attended meeting of the electors of the proposed electoral district of Sorell was held at the Blue Bell Inn, Sorell, on the 12th instant, to receive Mr. Atkin Morrison, the representative elect of the district, and to adopt much measures as might be requisite to ensure his return. The electors Assembled in great numbers, even from the distant parts of the district; and the large room was crowded to excess. An elegant though substantial and well provided repast was provided, at which W. H. Glover, jun., Esq., presided, supported by R, Crocker, E.4„as The usual loyal tons were given, when the President gave„Our future Representative Askin Morrison, Eng.\" Mr. Gilover passed merited eulogium upon Mr. Morrison, as man who had the clearperception of the wants of the colony, and who had during a mojourn of nearly 25 years in it, by his various efforts in the development of its resources and the improvement of its facilities of internal access and intercourse, proved his sagacity and foreight ;-as one who had left no opportunity animproved wherein his private fortune or his exertions could be brought to bear in its behalf and whose immonse transactions in commerce, in agriculture, and in whaling give the surest gunerantee that even on the ground of personal interest alone, he must have the welfare of the colony at heart, the interests of which were so extensively and so inseparably connected with his own :—alaman, moreover, whose liberal and onlightened principles rendered him peculiarly adapted to represent any community to which food goverment was desirable, or to which British rights and liberty were dear Mr. Glover also took occasion to deprecate the existence or encouragement of any feeling of animosity or ill-will on the part of the supporters of either Mr. Morrison or the formerly rival candidate, Mr. Gregonexprening it as the earnent hope and expectation of every intelligent person, that Mr. Morrison and Mr. Gregson would, on the advocates of all liberal and enlightened views, be found co-operating in the new Legislature in supporting and promoting those principles. The hoalh was drunk with enthusiastic and prolonged appinune. Mr. Morrison rose to return thanks, and referred them to their own experience of his career during the long period he had been known in the colony Throughout that career he had never attached himselt' to any party or political faction: whatever he had said or done had been diated by his own independent consciencelle had constantly availed himself of every opportunity that came within the influence of his means or his efforts to advance the interests of the colony. But he would give no pledgeshe would bind himself to no measures, if he entered that Assembly as a Representative, it would be unpledged unlettered, except by one single pledge-namely, that be would use his utmost exertion and his best judgment, independently and conscientiously, for the good of the colony; Mr. Morrison a luded to the fact, that he had a vast capital employed in agriculture in commerce-in whaling; and that, of all the proceeds and income of these concerns, he did not send one furthout of the colony. Hewent no money to England to pay the interest of Britisk borrored capital Nor was it his ultimate intention that his money should ever leave the shores of Van Diemen's Land: he had spent his best days in the Island, and he intended to be buried in its soil. Mr. Morrison sat down amidenthusiastic cheering and the social meeting terminated. Mr. W. H. Glover, jun., was again voted to the chair, and having opened the public meeting. It was proposed by Mr. C. A. Glover and seconded by Mr. Carte \"That this meeting, having heard the declaration of Aolin Morrison, E., as to his political sentiments, is confirmed in its opinion as to his fitness to represent the district of Sorell in the forthcoming Legislature; and accordingly resolves that it is not desirable that he should be returned as representative of the district.\" Mi Hodgson, of Richmond, rose to interrogate Mr. Morrison as to his views on the transportation question, Considerable interruption ensued. Whenience was obtained, the Chairman stated that he could on authority assert that Mr. Morrison was an opponent of transportation ; that he (the Chairman) was an ultratitransportationist; and that, if he had not good grounds for the conviction of Mr. Morrison's views, he would never have given him A vote or promoted his return. Mr. Hodgson.\" I wish to hear it from Mr. Morrison's own lips. Inokasimple question and I want nniple answer.\" Mr. Morrison stated that he had not come forward by his own choice the office was none of his seeking :-that he had been requested by the inhabitants to allow himself to be put nomination. He attached himself to no party or political creed, and would pledge itself to nothing but to promote the good of the colony according to his best judgment and ability. He had been accused of getting up a petition in favour of transportation ; whilst, on the contrary, he had really and actually been the bearer of one of the antitransportation petitions (which he received from Mr. Pitcairn), and had obtained many signatures to it during a journey into the interior. Mr. Hodgson persisting in his questions, the Chairman ruled that he was out of order:-that, if he had anything to submit to the meeting, he must propose it as a resolution, or an amendment to the one already road. Mr. Hodgsonchcu proposed as an amendment, seconded by Mr. Kearney. \"That tho meeting do adjourn until the electoral district be defined by the Council; and that when that fact shall become known, public meeting of electon be called.\" Mr. Hodgaon having obtained, with some diffully, a patient hearing in support of his amendment, it was put to the meeting, when about oix hands were shown in its favour out of nearly 300 persone present Mr. R. Cracker next proposed (seconded by Mr. Robert Doctor, and carried in the same That it is due to Mr. Morrison, from this meeting to express its entire satisfaction with the explanation of his sentiments given by that gentleman; and this meeting hereby accordingly Under to him its acknowledgment of the same.\" A committee was then appointed; vote of thanks was fiven to the Chairman ; and the meeting dispersed.

James Norton Jabea Barker Robert Johnson Richard Johnson. JRCKSTARINS AND TPBASURRS. Key. A. H. STEPEN, and Mr. ROBERT JOHNSON DROSPECTUS OF A CHURCH OY ENGLAND COLLEGE INOONNEXION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY. The Legislature of this colony, by the foundation and munificent endowment of the UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, having provided an Institution in which secular knowledge of the highest order may be required, but from which, by the terms of its constitution, Religious instruction is excluded, it has become • matter of deep importance that members of the Church of England, by the establishment of a College of their own, in connexion with the University, (as contemplate by the Act or to incorporation.) should be enabled to Tail themselves of the advantage time ffered. It in proposed to establish, therefore, in permanentaliance with the Sydney Universt#} Church of England College, to be eilled QURAN', COLLBOX; in which systematic Religious instruction, domestic supervision, and moral discipline, with elementary teaching and efficient assistancomÎpreparing for the University Lectures and Bxaminations, shall be provided for Students of the Univer aity, whose Guardians or Parents may desire to secure such advantages for them And thus, while the acquisition by them of all other Useful Knowledke will be facilitated, and that union of the Tutorial and Professorial systems be Attained, which is so important in Academical Education, the great object will be kept in view of Instilling into their minds & reverence for the doctrines and tenets of our Church : and Learning will be CODsociated, all it ever should be, to the service and honour of God. With these views, the following Plan and Arrangement (subject to modification by the subscribers hereafter) are proposed 1. That College Buildings shall be erected in the vicinity of Sydney; to consist of a Hall, Chapel, and Library, with residences for a Wardenad BabWarden, and rooms for about forty Studenta2. That the government of the College shall be vented in a Council, to consist of the War den and six fellows: 3. That the Metropolitan Bishop shall be Vini. tor of the College 4. That the Council shall draw up Rules, (with power to amend them, from time time, may be thought expedient,) for the management of the College, and the order of all thing therein the furtherance of true Religion and Learning. 6. That the Warden, who shall be Clergs. man in Prienta' Orders, shall be appointed by the six Pollow and the SubWarden be appointed by the Warden, subject to their approva! 6. That there shall be twenty-four Follows be longing to the College of whom eight shall be Clergymen in Priest\"' Orders. That the first twenty-four Follows shall be elected by the Subscribers and that al Vacancies in their number, by resignation or otherwise, shall be supplied by Graduates of the University continuing on the books of the College, 8. Provided that, until there shall be twenty such Graduates of the least, Vacancies among the Yellows shall be supplied by the remaining Felow; by election, in such manner as they may appoint 9. That the siz Felow members of the Council, who shall be called Senior Followo shall be elected by the twenty four Follows, from their own body. All Vacancies being supplied in like manner. - That, of the Senior Follows, three shall be Clergymen in Prieau Orden, and Laymen; and that they shall, every second year (oroftener if needbe),elect Bursar who mall have the control and administration of the revenues and disbursements of the College The Burser to be always capable of re-election, 11. That the Wardens (aubject to any rules made by the Council) shall have the general superintendence and control of the Stu dents, and of the Institution. 12. That arrangements shall be made, even tually, for the establishment of School, in immediate connection with the College; under such regulations, and supervision, the Council shall appoint. Thay an Act shall be sought from the Legislature for the permanent settlement and continuance of the College, upon the foundation, and for the purposcubere indianted : by incorporation, or otherwise, may be thought most desirable. In circulating the foregoing Prospectus of Church of England College, the Committee appointed at the Public Meeting held to promote to establishment, having given the subject their mature and anxious attention, and being Intified of the perfect practicability, a well as of the propriety and urgency of the object, earnestly invite co-operation in their design. The Commitee submit it for support, in the pursunion that a large portion of the Community will readly unite with them the advancement of principles, and the promotion of #system, within this colony, which have for eges been so conducive to the properity, the moral greatness, and the gory of England. They are anxioun, for the Members of their Church, to take advantage of the opportunity held out to them by the Legislature, of requiring instruction in the highest branches of secular learning: under Professors so distinguished, and admirably qualified in their respective departments, as those who now all the Chains in the Sydney University. But Church men, bowover influenced by such considerations, for that in the University one thing, the most sential, is yet wanting ; and they desire that, in this Colony as in England, mental improvement and Religion should move together, hand in hand. With such view, the establishment of an Institution to be called \"Queen'. Coller'\" has been projected, in connexion with the University and the Committee truating to the cordial sympathy of those interested in the undertaking, solicit subscriptions towards the object. On the amount so raised, will materially depend the extent of the undowment, which will be doubtless contributed by the Government and Legislature. The Committee, therefore, deeply sensible of the importance of this movement, trust that it will be met by prompt and generous aanistance. It will be observed, that the Prospectus contemplates the erection of Buidinp; and the Committee confidently expect that sufficient fund will be received, not for that object only but for a liberal endowment of the College. It is hoped, however, that arrangements may at once made, for the reception of Studenta attending the University, and their moral and religious supervision, by Clergymen willing to undertake that duty; or by other competent perons. It is proposed by the Committee, that subscription of £50 and upwards may be payable four manual payments, and that Subscribers shall be entitled to vote is the election of Wal, lowo, according to the following sonlaris.. £land under 100, one vote : 26 and under £100, to voted : £100 and under £200, four voton; £200 and under £400, siz vote; E400 ",

You are aware that on meeting you on the road to Woodside, immediately unter the receipt of your note of the 13th instant, I admitted that the report of that part of my speech of which you complained was incorrect; and you cannot but remember, unless you are wilfully forgetful, that at the meeting to which your published correspondence refers, in answer to my request to you to write you replied that you were unable and I again, therefore, with confidence affirm that during my stay at the said meeting you pened not a single wentonce. Your advice to me how to act, in circumstances which your fancy Alone has pictured, is most unnecessary, for higher principle and nobler motives than your recommendation will ALWAYNI trust, lend in all my pursuits and wpirations to employ such mens only as are both honest and lawful. Nornord I entertain much fear that those who know me, either in this district or elsewhere, will form their estimate of my character either from the charges which you preferagainst me, or from the insinuation which you make. As to all maquaintance, I can, with a clear conscience, appeal for an attestation to the correctness and temperite nature of my conduct. But in conclusion ask, can you with safety and asserance solicit your friends or the public testify to the morality or suborness of your life I am, Sir, your obedient servant, HENRY KELLY.

Gentlemen As a candidate for your District I beg to state that the following is shortly my political creed, which I will amplify at the various public meetings LAW REPORM.-I advocate that the mailnery of the Local Court (which for years has worked admirably), with additions to most proceedings in Equity, bo extended to the Supreme Court, instead of adopting the experimental Judionture Act, the satisfactory working of which in England has yet to be proved I would also allow only one appeal from any judicial decision. IKBOLVENT LAW.-I am of opinion that the State should interfereas little as possible between creditors and their debton. I would therefore have machinery sufficient to place the assets of debtor in the bands of his creditors. A Registrar, to be approved by the Chamber of Commerce, and a small staff of assistanta, could do all tho work necesary. A majority of creditors should bind the minority, and fraudu.lent insolventa tried by & Jury. TRIAL BY JURY. I would support an amendment of the law to enable a majority of a Jury to returnavoid-in all cases. REAL PROPERTY ACT.-It is a popular fallacy to suppose that my profession oppose this very Decessary and useful Act. Most of us bold our property and practis under it. I will preserve the fundamental principles of this Act in their integrity, and do all I can to make the Act perfect. TAXATION. As were hearily taxed for everything we use and consime, I will endeavour to shift a portion of the burden on to the shoul. ders of Absentees. LAND LAW_A, I believe the answer to the great cry of \"What shall we do with oursons!\" is \"Make them farmers,\" I would have the land offered at £1 per acre without interests are for each bolding extended to 1,000 acreslong credit given, and compulsory residence insistod upon so that the farmer may grow mutton, beef and wool in aduition to grain, IMMIGRATION.—Every facility should be given for colonists to get out their friends and relations, thus securing those wo pay for and amply supplying the wants of the country. POSTAGE AND TELEGRAPBS.-We are behind the age not adopting & penny postage and sixpenny telegrams throughout the colony. EDUCTION should be free, because I do not think the small payment, which it would be difficult to fix, would make a great reduction in the cont. Aud as I am of opinion that Justion losseps crime, we would save largely in other way. The Bible should be read schools, but the various religious views of our fellow-colonists are entitled to respect, and all should be allowed to participate in the Government sid as far supracticable. upon any other subjects I shall be happy to express my opinions at the meetings of Electors already advertised. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 3520 WM. R. WIGLEY. ",

Bertran (Chairman of the District Council of Stepney), Mr. H. Hughes (Mayor of Konsington and Norwood), Councillors Bailey, Hales, and Tradgon, and Messn, C. Smedley and D.J.Weir, wore introduced to the Minister of Ardoulture and Education (Hon. E. Ward), by Mr. R. T. Smith, M.P., on Monday, October 18, to represent the views of a public meeting in regard to school accommodation for Stepney. Mr. E. T. SMITE said that the object of the deputation wastubare schoolif not two saboolserested in the eastern suburbs. The meeting that the deputation represented bed urged that School should be at once erected at Steppey; but it be had his way he would bero Likod to see two erected to provide for the munisipality of Kensington and Norwood as well as Stepboy and the other places that would be taken I by the one school. The eastern suburbs Bor had & population of 10,000, which waronetwontieth of the population of South Australia Hobelieved that it was pointemplated by the Government to orsot school at Norwood, of the same scal as the Model School in Adelaide; but he thought it would be found to know better if they had two schools not so large, M. J. BRATRAN. Chairman of the Stoppey District Council, said that the people of Stepney bad for a long time felt the weat of a fahool to which they could send their children. The lata meeting had one in favour of schools both Stepney and Norwood and Kensington, but they felt that if two were bructed instead of one they might not be masters to them that would be Bofficient. If one school only was to be built which would now of the Government providing the best masters, they thought that the site might be somewhere in the vicinity of the Maid and Magpie Hotel In that position it would take in some populous suburbe, Mr. H. Hughes, Mayor of Kensington and Norwood, thought the deputation had a strong claim upon the Government, and was glad ta have been able to sacompany them He could may little as to the school accommodation, and whother one central or two smalones would be most preferable, simply because he did not know how the stablishment of the schools by the Government would be allowed to affect Mr. Baigent's school, which was now to operation at Kensington, and which was in the nature of $ first-class estabishment. He was sure that a school now the Maid and Magpio, and one near the Clayton Chapel, would be largely attended Mr. O. SMRDLEY agreed with what the speakers bad said who had proceed him, and thought that it would be found that a school at Stepney would be largely attended. Mr. Councillor HALES thought & school of the description that had been a ludod to would be found lasting benefit to the wholo neighbourhood. The new Education Bal was a throughly good and practicalmossure, and what was wanted to give its benefits to the public was the establishment in such places M Stephey of schools like the Model Schools of Adelaide. If only one sobool was to be aracted he believed that Stepney badaprior alaim over Kensington and Norwood. Mr. WARD said be recognised and the Government fully recognised the value of practical information from gentlemen living in the neighbourhood, who must know much that they could not. The intention of the Government with regard to the eastern suburbs was to have established one school, on the principlo of the Model School in Adelaide, at Norwood. Howas not aware that any particular locality had been fixed upon, but generally it was intended to take in Kensington and Norwood, and also include College Town and K\" Town. There was one thing to be considered. The Gover ment could much more easily supply bricks and mortar to build those bigh-class schools than got a sufficient number of first-class toachers to carry them on. It was for the deputation to consider whether they would not be better off with one school, in which there would be bighclass mastent, then with two secondalone behools. The arrangementa for training teachers wore progresaing, but the supply would not be increased from this source for some time. They had also ta Pay considerable attention to districtsbad not yet had any schoolgrinted to them and if they had two first-olan schools, on \" Norwood and on at Stepney, he thought they would have more accommodation than the city, Bedde, school to be reobod at Irishtown would take in a part of Hackney Hope ever, if the deputation would consider from their own point of view what would be the best for the distrist to have one firstalasa school or two of the second class, ho would bring the matter before his colleagues, and if they pleaed the Government would communioate with Mr. Smith, or the Chairman of the District Council before site was chosen. Mr. SMITH thought if only one school was to be built that the people of Kensington would now it to be erected at Stepney. Mr. HUGHBS thought that two inforior sohools would be better for the district than tbe one of the highest alans, Mr. WARD said their viowe should be attended to. ",

Mason, P.M., published in your columng x few day there is serior which nodsorrection Is is stated Mr. MID Was not appointed coronar Lil 1938, but the fact is he was appointed A coroner 1835, Ai-igned his onmmission in 1863, but wa respinted in 1868 on taking the appointment of police magistrato at Launceston. During the years elapwed wince then, Mr. Masou has buld 225 inquest without any remuneration. (We have correction to this effect from the Rov. A. N. Union, of St. John's, New Town, but the above dispenses with the necossity of publishing it.] The inhabitants of the pretty little village of St. Leonards are agitating to have the water laid on to their promises, and are apparently not afraid to pas their bands in their pockets for the luxury.The two main (18in, and 10m.) which supply Laundobon pass within comple of miles of St. Loonards, but Ikoroharange of bills intervening whicla prevent them getting #main aid down from the purpoint, and the branch would have to start within a mile of Lageouston, making nearly three milonopipe necesary. A public meeting was held of the St. Leonardo Institute last night, when it was abown the cost of laying down the main would be about £2000, and the annual cost to the towebip £200, Boesitate ten per cent rate upon property boldore, but on the other hand it was shown that under the present system of ouring water from Clark'. Ford, those who had not a borse and cart of their own were paying more than 10 per cent rate would amount to se they are charged la. Bil; and 2.load for the water. A resolution we passed in favour of incurring the liability, and committee appointed to Canvas the landbolders for their signatures m. guarantee for the payment of the rate. I am glad to see the spirit displayed in the matter, and the water supply of Launcoton is nor ample for balladozen townhips berides St. Leonards, if we had them hand). Since the day the newlin mail was laid down, the valveat its head has never been opened more than 3in, and if wa, who had to tunel hill and bring our wor fifteen miles, to obtain such a supply at a total cost of £37,000 for both malus, it is a standing diagrace to the Corporation of the capital that with what might be made annexhaustible reservoir standing only a few miles from the city, the water supply at Hobart Town should bo so point I barily wish Pastor Chiniquy had never visited these shores. In Launceston we baroalways beauremarkably united omspunity. And religious or class disensions have beon Almost unknown amongst us. The beneficial elect of this unity is abown in the manner in which Bocieties and lnstitutions of all kinds flourish, for I do not believe there is a town of its size in the Australian colonies which has so many nocieties of Duo kind and another mLauboeston, In religious matters we have been very free from bigotry. There laCCatholic Church in the northern districts that has not been aided by Protest support when building there has not been charitablaffort or wtertainment that has not beended and helped by Catholic hands, and now change had come or the spirit of the pono,\" which appears solely due to the riots and disgraceful disturbance at the capital. When Chiniquy lectured here the good one and influence of the two Catholio clergymen, who deuervedly bear the respect of all motiode of the community, provented any unneen proceedingethere was not even a private fight over the matter. The local Dewspapers Avoided w much as possible giving offence to any particular section of the community. And but for the subeequent proceedings Pastor Chiniquy's visit bere would have had but little offect upon the good feeling of the public generally, Even the Orange Lodge, which had good doal to do with this vixit, wa# quiet and unobtrusive dut until Chiniquy publicly ALBounced the fact ball the town did not know there wasmuch an institusiog bore, though to my knowledge it has existed for two years at least. But the proceedings of the following wook have stirred up a feeling to a great extont, and have croated change whioh I fear will not only a sway. The discovery that an armed and turbulent mob could upset the public peace and order of the capital, could few hours raise an organisation which would bring recruits from every country district to it aid, which was prepared to resitDVD to the shodding of wood, the law and the police, and annume to itaeltwbitration of the limita of that liberty of speech which out of ou have been brought up to believe was our birthright N Englishmen, has had a very serious effect here and has led many to look upon Pastor Chiniquy and his statements with an interest they would never ba otherwise vouchsafed. The remarkably world wvertisement of Bishop Murphy has been the of general, and I may sayaverse comment, and many horelelieve that the riots would nover bayerison had it not been that the rioters thought they ball the secret approval of their largyran. The procopdings at the capital have led to lloeling and bagd speaking here, havanown needs of dinnion which may bear troublesome fruit, have cauned rocrats to seek the Orange Lodge who would never therwise have gone Dear it, and have created such a foabog generally us bas never before upon raised prep my public atter. This state of affairs is deeply to be regretted, life is to short for quarrelling, and the day has long one past for religione bigotry and intolerance, in social matters at all sveta. It is pouille matter may bake down into their od groove; it is pingerely to be hoped so Bathere are two rumours floating about, which, if true, will have moapemigious effoot at the prewant juncture One that Pastor Allou, who created auch disturbances by hisopenair addresses in Hyde Park, Sydney, some time ago, is coming bere ; and the other, that the Orangemen intend to lobirate, by procession, the anniversary of the \"Closing of the bates of Derry,\" on the 12th inst. I don'think Pastor Allen's visit will dopapy good, socially or Borally: and aw for the other matter, many who however the evil effects of Orangeiate in order countresseriouwly object to the perpetuation of old udbygone events which have little or noguiticano in these colonies. I think the gates of Terry were closed againstan O'Neil, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, but I am not certain. But to us, in Temania, it is as little importance as the closing of the call of Limerick Against King William The Eaglinh Government, 1843, found if necessary to prohibit all Orange processions throughout Ireland Por unde yearsonsocount of the illfeeling and not they avokadTimes are changed for the better since that we havality of speech, onnoience, and of everything we wink, and should therefore avoid any publio demonstrations which cannot be productive of publio good, and may be productive of much illfeeling. We hava had overal Accounts recently of Antal accidents from the N. W. Count; and another sadale comes from Nulpbur Crock, a few miles from the Penguin, wherealittlegirlly three years old, daughter of Mr. G.

Harvey, for the purpose of making arrangements with the Government for the construction of a railway Derth of Port Augusta on the guarantee principle. The scheme, however, fell through, and Mr. Wallace returned to Scotland. He retired shortly afterwards from business, and lived quietly Dear Peterboad. His wife died some four years ago, and the deceased Deveralled from the effects of the event.

Dalton, of Adelaide. When finished the hall will, it is said, be quite equal to say out of Adelaide. Thx COPPER MARKET IN ENGLAND.-From the London Mining Journal of June 28 note the following :—'Sellers continurmer in their quotations, and were it not for the unsatisfactory turu which the Indian exchange has taken slightly better prices might ere this have been obtainable. It seems almost as though the late of the market for this metál is doomed, for whenever there has been any chance of little sport taking place in prices something has invariably turned up to check the advance. From time time there have been many fale starts to secure higher prices, but sellers have never since the downward torn commenced soceeded in maintaining Boy advance more than for a very abort time, but have constantly had to return to their former rates. It is greatly to be hoped, however, that the attemptarise which is now being made will not be altogether fruitles, and that advanced rates may soon be established throughout the trade, for up to the present time the only consulation left to sellers is that owing to the reduced prices quotations must have declined to about their minimum. Itreets, however, mainly with producers; if they restrict their future production then higher prices will soon be brought about; but if, on the other band, they continue to send forward wupplies a freely as they have been doing, then doubtlesalower priceacre long will have again to be accepted. At the public ticketing held Isat Tuesday at Swansea 1,788 tons fore were sold at average of 10s. 6d. per int.\" PROPOSED FAIR AT GAWZR.-　The committee appointed to carry out this project evidently intend to try and make it succes, and at the meeting held by them on Tuesday evening, August 12, the following resolution was carried, tbe object in view being to secure the coperation of all the residents:-Resolved, that & petition to His Worship the Mayor of Gowler be presented, asking him to convene a public meeting at an early date to consider the desirability of arranging for a fair to be held in Gawler.\" The matter was left in the hands of the Hon.
